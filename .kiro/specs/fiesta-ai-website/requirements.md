# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a multi-model AI chat comparison platform inspired by Fiesta AI. The core innovation is sending a single prompt to multiple AI models simultaneously and streaming their responses in real-time for side-by-side comparison. The platform is built using Next.js 14 with App Router, Tailwind CSS, and Jotai for state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select multiple AI models from a sidebar, so that I can compare their responses to the same prompt simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible sidebar with available AI models
2. WHEN a user selects one or more models THEN the system SHALL update the selection state
3. WHEN a user deselects a model THEN the system SHALL remove it from active models
4. IF no models are selected THEN the system SHALL disable the prompt input
5. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN the system SHALL maintain model selections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send a single prompt to all selected models at once, so that I can efficiently compare their responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the prompt input THEN the system SHALL accept text input with auto-resizing textarea
2. WHEN a user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL send it to all selected models simultaneously
3. WHEN the prompt is being processed THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators for each model
4. IF the prompt is empty THEN the system SHALL prevent submission
5. WHEN a prompt is submitted THEN the system SHALL clear the input field

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time streaming responses from multiple models side-by-side, so that I can compare their output quality and speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models start responding THEN the system SHALL stream text in real-time to dedicated columns
2. WHEN on desktop THEN the system SHALL display responses in a multi-column grid layout
3. WHEN on mobile THEN the system SHALL display responses in a tabbed interface
4. WHEN a model completes its response THEN the system SHALL remove the loading indicator
5. IF a model encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message in that column

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with individual model responses, so that I can copy useful content and manage the output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a copy button THEN the system SHALL copy the full response text to clipboard
2. WHEN a response is copied THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation indicator
3. WHEN a user scrolls within a response column THEN the system SHALL maintain independent scroll positions
4. WHEN responses are long THEN the system SHALL handle overflow with appropriate scrolling
5. IF clipboard access fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle concurrent API requests efficiently, so that multiple models can be queried without rate limiting issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple models are selected THEN the system SHALL use staggered Promise.allSettled approach
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL route through a secure serverless proxy
3. WHEN rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate delays
4. IF an API key is missing THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
5. WHEN responses stream THEN the system SHALL use Server-Sent Events with distinct event names

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want scalable state management, so that new models can be added without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL use a dynamic Map atom for model states
2. WHEN a new model is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically handle its state
3. WHEN model states change THEN the system SHALL update only affected components
4. IF state updates fail THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency
5. WHEN models are added or removed THEN the system SHALL scale without performance degradation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use the comparison tool on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on desktop THEN the system SHALL show sidebar and multi-column layout
2. WHEN accessed on mobile THEN the system SHALL show collapsible sidebar and tabbed responses
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support accessibility standards
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels
5. IF the layout breaks THEN the system SHALL maintain usability across breakpoints
